#####Purpose
As online human interaction traces from social media sites, wearables, and apps have become ubiquitous, there are still persistent
research challenges exist. Scientists lack the tools, methods, and practices to combine, compare, contrast, and communicate about online
behavior over time and across online locations. 

#####Introduction
We are currently developing an application that we hope will help advance science beyond a deluge of studies focused on singular sites for
online human interaction and to create a cumulative science of online communities, we must develop an infrastructure where scientists can
systematically share, annotate, analyze, and integrate data from previous studies across multiple online sources. Our site will consist of
students, data scientists, and researchers. For right now, each user has the same privileges. Eventually(by the end of the week), our site
will have different privileges for different users. You can currently search for data, upload data, and download data. Anyone can register
as a new user. Once registered, you use your email and password you used to sign up as your login. 

#####Design
Design of the website was influenced by the simplicity of the Open Science Framework site, offering a similar browsing feature to peruse
through the available manifests. Instead of having a navigation bar on the top, the site utilizes a sidebar that can be accessed at any
time, but also has a toggle feature to hideaway and allow the user to view the information on a clear slate. As time would allow, the
ideal state would be to have the website integrated for mobile and tablet platforms, with reading features that would function much like a
Kindle. The Open Science Framework site also offers a login/logout feature, where the account creation is also similar, asking for a name,
email, and password. 

The sidebar contains the four most important tasks for the user: search, upload, download, and logout. There is also an about page for
important information that can later be updated. As stated in the purpose, OCDX wants to create a sharing hub for scientific discoveries.
As a researcher, publishing materials pertains to the upload function; as a student, the download function; and as any user, the search
function. The site features easy to follow inputs and guides for each page. 

For search, there is an input field to type keywords and two search functions to either bring up a list of manifests or usernames
pertaining to the keywords. On the upload page, users are prompted to choose a file from their computer, and can click the upload button
to submit it. In the future, this will be extrapolated to more fields such as a title, key contributor, and keywords to link to it.
Lastly, there is download, which displays a list of manifests and a button for copying the information directly to a personal computer.
Eventually, the search and download pages will be merged.

The future design would also feature administrative privileges, allowing a distinguishing feature between users being either students or
researchers in order to create credibility to what manifests are being posted. The design keeps the functions rather simple; for this
stage, the site opts out of personal messaging and contacting, instead keeping search/upload/download/ as its main navigational functions.
