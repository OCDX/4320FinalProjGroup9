As online human interaction traces from social media sites, wearables, and apps have become ubiquitous, there are still persistent
research challenges exist. Scientists lack the tools, methods, and practices to combine, compare, contrast, and communicate about online
behavior over time and across online locations. 

To advance science beyond a deluge of studies focused on singular sites for online human
interaction and to create a cumulative science of online communities, we have developed an infrastructure where scientists can 
systematically share, annotate, analyze, and integrate data from previous studies across multiple online sources.
